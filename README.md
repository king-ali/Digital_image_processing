# Digital image processing

This repository contain assignments of digital image processing taught by Dr. Shahzor Ahmad

# Assignment 1
* Gamma Mapping of HDR Images for 8-bit Display
* Image Subtraction for Tamper Detection
* Nightime Road Contrast Enhancement

# Assignment 2
implementation of a basic version of the interactive image cut-out / segmentation approach called Lazy Snapping using K-mean clustering

# Assignment 3
Line Detection via the Hough Transform and analysis of the best parameters used such as edge magnitude threshold used to determine edge pixels vs. non-edge pixels, size of the accumulator cells (in terms of pixels) in the Hough space, the min and max range of the Hough parameters a, b, peak detection threshold in the Hough space, etc.
